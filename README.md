# Data Science Salary Calculator - Excel Dashboard

An interactive Excel dashboard designed to explore and visualize global salary trends and job market data for data-related roles. This project was created for educational purposes following the "Excel for Data Analysis" curriculum by Luke Barousse.

## 📊 Overview

The goal of this dashboard is to provide actionable insights into the data science job market. It allows users to filter through various roles and regions to understand compensation levels, where jobs are being posted, and the volume of opportunities available.

### Key Features
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Filter data by **Job Title** (e.g., Data Analyst, Senior Data Scientist), **Country**, and **Employment Type** (Full-time, Contractor, etc.).
* **Salary Benchmarking:** A bar chart comparing median salaries across different data roles.
* **Global Map Visualization:** A geographic heat map visualization to show data distribution across the globe.
* **Live KPI Cards:** Real-time updates for:
    * **Median Salary:** Calculated based on the selected filters.
    * **Top Job Platform:** Identifies which site (e.g., Indeed, LinkedIn) has the most listings for the selection.
    * **Job Count:** Shows the total number of data points/postings available.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
* **Microsoft Excel:** Advanced Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Data Modeling.
* **Data Visualization:** Custom charts, Map charts, and KPI card design.
* **Data Cleaning:** Handling null values and formatting salary data for consistency.

## 📁 Data Source & Limitations
* **Source:** The dataset was provided as part of the "Excel for Data Analysis - Full Course for beginners" tutorial.
* **Limitations:** Please note that this is a sample dataset used for learning purposes. Some countries may have limited or no data available, which is reflected in the dashboard when specific filters are applied.

## 🎓 Learning Objectives
This project was built to master:
1. Building a user-friendly interface in Excel.
2. Connecting Slicers to multiple Pivot Tables for a synchronized dashboard experience.
3. Translating raw data into meaningful business metrics (KPIs).

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the Excel file.
2. Use the drop-down menus and slicers at the top to select a **Job Title**, **Country**, or **Employment Type**.
3. The charts and metrics will automatically update to reflect your selection.
